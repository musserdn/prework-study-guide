# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This project provides a way to organize all of the information learned throughout the prework modules and puts it in a highly organized and accessable format. That way it can be easily referenced by myself (and others!) throughout the course.

## Installation

## Usage

The deployed html can be accessed using your default web browser. Once there, you can reach about each section highlighted by their respective headers. If you open DevTools, you can look at the console to see the JavaScript running and will provide you one of the topics to study first.
